# MVP - LOOP MACHINA (Techno Sequencer)

MVP project for InnoTech College. I decide to code a simple drum machine of my favorite genre.
There are 9 tracks with their own dedicated sounds. Each track can be manipulated to turn on or off.
There is also an animated playhead that moves along with the beat of the kick.

Coded using:
JavaScript / p5.js
HTML
Sass
